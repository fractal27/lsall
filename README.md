# lsall

`lsall` is a project that focuses on the tree-like visualization of a directory, with various arguments.

## Installation

For Linux the installation is simple

1. Download the project via git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GDominici07/lsall.git
```

2. Run `make install`

and just run in bash the simple command while in the cloned project

If you are intruigued at how the installation process works, it just uses a combination of Makefile and some copy commands to add the executable files to the directory `/usr/local/bin/` and the manual(man1) page to the directory `/usr/share/man/man1`.

*NOTE*: Windows and MacOS installation is not yet implemented. but can be achieved via
`make`, moving the binaries to path and running the program

## Usage
The usage of `lsall` is:

    lsall [options] [file1] [file2...]

And here are the various options:

```
-p To enter only one path, the argument in -p. (default is \'./\')
-f Character in the first row of every line. (default is \'\|\')
-F Filler between the first character and the filename representing the
    current depth of the file.(if not inserted is \"\~\")
-e Doesn\'t show the unicode characters(emoji) used to represent files,
    directories\...
-s Shows the size of each file.
-d DEPTH Depth of the recursive search (If depth is negative, it will be
    counted as infinity.)
-D Only show directories from output.
-i Read file path from standard input ( The prompt is not set by default. )
```
## Examples

If you want to use to display a the tree of your project without all the directories and you are
using a terminal without UNICODE emoji support, you can use the `-e` to not show emojis.

And use the flag `-d` to set the depth to the level you prefer, for example:

```bash
$ lsall -e -d 1

If you want to ignore a specific pattern of name or directory (e.g `.git`) you can do that using the argument `-x`(x for delete from visible)

```bash
$ lsall -d1 -x ".git"

## man page

The [manual page](src/lsall.1)(man1) is a man1 made page of the lsall project, and 
it is automatically installed using `make install`.

You can access it using the normal `man lsall` if the program is installed globally, but if you don't want to install it, you can still look at the manual using the relative path: `man src/lsall.1`.

Here is a screenshot of the manpage from the current version of the man page of lsall.
